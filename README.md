# React Native AgoraIO Call 

Call can host multiple participants. Audio call only for now.

I already added "participant is muted" and "participant is speaking" use cases.

Create a .env file at root directory and put required environment variables from .env.example with your custom values.

You need an API endpoint to to generate agora temporary tokens on every join. check generateAgoraToken().
